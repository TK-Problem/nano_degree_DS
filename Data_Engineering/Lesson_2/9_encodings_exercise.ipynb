    "\n",
    "Encodings are a set of rules mapping string characters to their binary representations. Python supports dozens of different encoding as seen here in [this link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings). Because the web was originally in English, the first encoding rules mapped binary code to the English alphabet. \n",
    "\n",
    "The English alphabet has only 26 letters. But other languages have many more characters including accents, tildes and umlauts. As time went on, more encodings were invented to deal with languages other than English. The utf-8 standard tries to provide a single encoding schema that can encompass all text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that it's difficult to know what encoding rules were used to make a file unless somebody tells you. The most common encoding by far is utf-8. Pandas will assume that files are utf-8 when you read them in or write them out.\n",

    "There are dozens of encodings that Python can handle; however, Pandas assumes a utf-8 encoding. This makes sense since utf-8 is very common. However, you will sometimes come across files with other encodings. If you don't know the encoding, you have to search for it.\n",
