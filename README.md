### Lesson 1

**CRISP-DM** (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining). Folder contains Jupyter notebooks about data exploration, preparation, modeling and evaluating results. In all notebooks stack overflow survey data was analyzed. 

In `Putting It All Together.ipynb` notebook, Linear Regression model is used to identify most important salary 
predicting features. 

### Project #4

Blog post about X was written (add link). Data processing code is available on separate Github repo (add link).

## 5. Software Engineering

### Lesson 2

In this lesson, example code was refactored to increase performance and readability.

## 6. Data Engineering

### Lesson 2

**ETL** (extract transform load) pipeline. Folder contains Jupyter notebooks about:
 
* loading data from various file formats,
* transforming data (cleaning missing values, creating dummy variables, scaling features, ect.),
* loading data into SQLite database.

### Lesson 3

**NLP** (natural language processing) pipeline. Folder contains Jupyter notebooks about:

* webscraping and processing text of Udacity course website,
* normalize text (lower case words, remove punctuation, ect.),
* tokenization (split text into words or sentences),
* Part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition,
* stemming and lemmatization.

### Lesson 4

Machine Learning (ML) pipeline. In `grid_search.ipynb` notebook, ML pipeline with Feature union and Grid search was built to classify twitter text messages. Other notebooks contain examples of different parts of ML pipeline.
