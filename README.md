### Lesson 2

In this lesson, example code was refactored to increase performance and readability.

## 6. Data Engineering

### Lesson 2

**ETL** (extract transform load) pipeline. Folder contains Jupyter notebooks about:
 
* loading data from various file formats,
* transforming data (cleaning missing values, creating dummy variables, scaling features, ect.),
* loading data into SQLite database.

### Lesson 3

**NLP** (natural language processing) pipeline. Folder contains Jupyter notebooks about:

* webscraping and processing text of Udacity course website,
* normalize text (lower case words, remove punctuation, ect.),
* tokenization (split text into words or sentences),
* Part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition,
