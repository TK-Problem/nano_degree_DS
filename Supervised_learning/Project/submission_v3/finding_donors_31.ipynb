    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given datase has 8 categorical and 5 continous features, hence I avoided Logistic regression model and chose to try ensemble classifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdaBoostClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaboosting algorithms  are used on a optical character recognition **[1]**, e.g. basketbal player detection **[2]**. It is also used in biology field and for speech processing **[3]**.\n",
    "- Adaboost can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms **[3]**. Compared to SVM, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings **[3]**. \n",
    "- It can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers **[3]**.\n",
    "- Adaboos was first succesfully developed for for binary classification **[4]**. Given problem is also binary probelm ('<=50K' : 0, '>50K' : 1), hence I decided to try it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### RandomForestClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- Banking, medicine, stock market, e-commere. In Banking Random Forest is used to detect customers who will use the bank’s services more frequently than others and repay their debt in time **[5]**. \n",
    "- Random Forest can be used for both regression and classification tasks **[5]**. In addition, this classifier won’t overfit, if there are enough trees in the forest **[6]**. Finally, it can be used for identifying the most important features from the training dataset, i.e. feature engineering **[6]**.\n",
    "- For real-time predictions a large number of trees makes this algorithm slow and ineffective **[5]**. In addition, Random Forest is a predictive modeling tool and not a descriptive tool, therefore, if you are looking for a description of the relationships in your data, other approaches would be preferred **[5]**.\n",
    "- As mentioned in advantages section, Random Forest can be used for both regression and classification tasks. Our data exacly consists of both continous and catecorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GradientBoostingClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is applied to similiar problems as models above. An exaple from internet, gradient boosting was used to assess the effects of watershed and reach characteristics on riverine assemblages **[7]**.\n",
    "- Reduce bias and variance **[8]**.\n",
    "- Can overfit **[8]**.\n",
    "- Same as for other mentioned models, data is mostly categorical. I think this model will compete with Random forrest, which will work better \"bagging\" or \"boosting\".\n",

    "Model takes one of the features and makes first rough estimate/guess about the data, for example people whose net capital gain above 0.5 will have income above 50k. It is very unlikely that such first guess will be correct about all the data, but this is expected. For the next guess, model only looks at the data, which was incorrectly classified with the initial guess, in our case let’s say that after initial guess we see that 30 people whose capital gain was above 0.5 had net income less than 50k, while 15 people whose net gain was below 0.5 had income above 50k. Using this error data model makes a new guess. Such guesses are called “weak learners”. This guessing process continues for some time. After we are satisfied with our guesses, we sum all our guess into one model about capital gain. Such procedure is done for other features and then finally everything is merged into one model about 13 features predicting whatever person earns more than 50k.\n",

    "* I also tested features on the \"Gradientboosting\" (results presented bellow). Interestingly, slightly different dominant features were identified (instead of hour-per-week, marial status was). Also capital gain had a greater weight than capital loss.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
